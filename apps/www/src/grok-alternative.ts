The computer in the default setup is a cloud computer on your account. Bots on that account share it, including files and logins. An optional local computer can run approved commands on the machine in front of you. That local computer is not the same thing as installing the Grok Bot service on a server you operate. The docs do not describe that install.",

SuperGrok is listed at $30 a month and includes Grok Bot access. Plans include weekly usage, and extra usage can be billed. The free plan on the pricing page does not list Grok Bot.",
      "Two other xAI releases are easy to mix up with the bot. Grok Build, the coding-agent CLI, is Apache-2.0. The older Grok-1 model weights were released under Apache-2.0. Neither of those is the Grok Bot service, and neither one is a self-hosted Grok Bot.",

      "Rakazo is an open source AI agent for persistent teammates, and a self-hosted AI assistant. It is in beta. Each bot keeps conversations, memory, routines, and history. It can use a browser, a terminal, files, and a graphical desktop, and it can hand work to another bot or a short-lived subagent. The clients are the web app, the Electron desktop app, and the Expo mobile app.",
      "Like Grok Bot, Rakazo is just chat once it is running. You set up the bot and manage it from that chat. A new bot interviews you about the work. Routines are readable Markdown and can run on a schedule. A bot can pause for approval when a task crosses a boundary you set, and actions are recorded in an audit log. Optional connectors can attach Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage via Sendblue, and Feishu/Lark. They are not required.",
      "The parts that are not Grok Bot are the ones you operate. The license is Apache-2.0. You self-host with published Docker images or from source. Hosted Rakazo Cloud is not generally available. Sign in with Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus/Pro, or SuperGrok, or bring a key for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or a local model server such as Ollama or LM Studio. Rakazo does not pay the model bill. Each bot can use a different model. Connector credentials are encrypted on your server and are not returned by the API.",
      "Computers are separate from the chat product. Local Docker is the default. E2B, Daytona, CreateOS, and Box are optional remote computers. An explicit desktop provider can run on the host, and it is not the default. Team computers are shared. Private computers are isolated.

    question: "Is Grok Bot open source?",

      "Grok Bot, the hosted teammate app, does not publish its source for you to run. xAI has open-sourced other software: Grok Build, the coding-agent CLI, is Apache-2.0, and the older Grok-1 model weights were released under Apache-2.0. Those projects are not the Grok Bot service. Rakazo is Apache-2.0, and the application source is public on GitHub.",

  {
    question: "Can I self-host Grok Bot?",
    answer:
      "The Grok Bot docs describe a cloud computer assigned to your account. They also describe an optional local computer, where a bot runs approved commands on the machine in front of you. They do not describe installing the Grok Bot service on a server you operate. Rakazo can be self-hosted.",

  {
    question: "How is Rakazo different from Grok Bot?",
    answer:
      "Both are persistent bots that can use a computer, sign in to tools, keep context, and run routines. Grok Bot hosts that computer for you and comes with paid Cursor plans and SuperGrok subscriptions. Rakazo is open source: you host it, you choose the model, and team computers and private computers stay separate. Hosted Rakazo Cloud is not generally available yet.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Rakazo just chat, like Grok Bot?",
    answer:
      "After the install, yes. You create an account, connect a model, and manage the bot from that chat. A new bot interviews you. Routines, memory, and approval boundaries stay with the bot. Rakazo is that chat plus the computer you run. Grok Bot is also a chat for named bots. The difference is who hosts the service and who picks the model.",
